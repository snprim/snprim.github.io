\section{Introduction}

\section{Big picture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "In the enhanced E-step, we impose variable selection to evaluate the Q-function more accurately, while in the enhanced M-step we find better estimates for the covariances." (p. 2124)
    \item Variable selection in the enhanced E-step is achieved by using the group lasso penalty. (p. 2125)
    \item Enhanced M-step: not iterative, so it has computational advantages. (Details given in equations (25) and (26) on p. 2125.
    \item Implementation details on pp. 2126-2127.
\end{itemize}
